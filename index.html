     <p> Hello my name is Tristan Curran. This website is my programming page for my freshman year Computer Science class, 
     also known as CSC 106. In this website you can see all of the different projects I created this year. When you click
     on the apps tab, it will bring you to all of the different applications I created this year. The Javascripts tab has
     all of the different javascripts I created throughout my freshman year, using devices that I learned from Khan Achademy.
        Lastly, the about me page shows more personal information about myself. </p>
