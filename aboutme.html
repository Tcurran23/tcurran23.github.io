          The Spread Of Coronavirus
At the beginning of this virus, I could only begin to think about the relation to one specific movie. That movie is, “World War Z”. “World War Z” is a movie about a virus that spreads through a single bite, turning healthy people into vicious animals. As the pandemic threatens to wipe out mankind, the main character Brad Pitt, tries to find a cure to this horrible disease. 
One scene from this movie that reminds me of today is the grocery store scene. Brad Pitt and his family go into the grocery store and there is nothing on the shelves, and he cannot provide any food for his family. This relates to today because going into the stores, shelves are basically empty, there is no toilet paper, no paper towels, people are freaking out and trying to stock up on food for their families in case this gets worse.
As of right now there are a total of 12,929 deaths in the United States alone, and this number will only continue to increase until we start taking the right precautions and start working together. Every single person during this time matters, they are brothers, sisters, parents of other people. 
Watching the news, hearing the tragic number of deaths keep going up is terrible. Families are not not allowed to have a funeral because of this awful virus. They cannot celebrate their lives because of this. As we see China start to overcome this pandemic, the United States will most likely follow their protocols. Such as a massive lockdown, preventing people from leaving their houses so the virus stops spreading from person to person. Seeing someone you know get sick is one of the worst feelings in the world. We want our loved ones and people around us to have the best health and living that they can have. With the coronavirus now spreading, we must stick together during this time, and make sure everyone is safe. People should be self quarantined and stopping themselves from leaving their home so we can go back to the norm. The people who are consistently going out and not caring about the lives of others are these “vicious animals” we see in “World War Z”. The virus will keep spreading until these people stop. Do you want to be part of the problem or the solution? You decide.
