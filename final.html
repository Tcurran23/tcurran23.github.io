     <p> Hello my name is Tristan Curran, and this is my final project for my CSC 106 Class. For my final project, my partner Jeffrey Ferreira and I decided to make connect 4. 
         The reason we decided to make connect 4 is because as a child we both played it, and it we thought it would be fun to create it. 
         To play this game, click the start button to begin. Then there will be two colored pieces, the first player will be red, and the second player will be yellow.
         To win this game one player must get their pieces to be 4 in a row in a horizontal position or vertical position. 
         Once a player achieves this goal, the win screen will pop up, and the game is completely over.</p>
